We downloaded the following three text-based data files with descriptions on July, 2018 from Cedar Creek website http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/experiments/e120

(1) e120_Plant aboveground biomass data.txt  
(2) e120_Plant species percent cover data.txt
(3) e120_Plot coordinates for the E120 Big Biodiversity Field.txt

These data came from the biodiversity experiment (E120) conducted in Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve by Tilman et al.

For our purpose of analysis, we extracted necessary data we used in our Paper and saved those extracted data in the following files as text format:

(i) edited_ple120.txt : extracted from (1)
(ii) edited_pce120.txt : extracted from (2)
(iii) edited_plots.txt : extracted from (3)
