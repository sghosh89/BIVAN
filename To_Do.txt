1) Need to modify documentation for :
 			- FittingCopula_selective_loc.R
			- Nonparamstat.R
			- vivj_matrix.R
			- bivfunctionplot.R

2) At present r chunk 112-114, 123-124 calculates skewness 
	and Taylors law res. for aphids and planktons with all sp.
   If we did not say anything with this results 
	then can I reove those chunks?

3) Add README.md

4) Describe each data section (not sure which version of data should I add in Data folder)
