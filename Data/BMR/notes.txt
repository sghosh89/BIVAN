Mammals BMR vs body size info, with a focus on using data 
  collected using best practices of experimental protocols.
Their database is an XLS spreadsheet with data quality scores.
The "ALL" data column the set of samples used when they tried to 
  find one sample for each species - even if the best record was
  of low quality.
The "SELECT" data column is the one that we probably want to use.
  This only includes a species when there is a high quality
  datum (E=1 or 2 in their E quality scheme).
The "SPOILED" data column has the same number of species as the
  "SELECT" data set, but the lower quality data are used.

The paper reports substantial effects of not filtering correctly.
