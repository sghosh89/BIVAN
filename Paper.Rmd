# Abstract

All branches of ecology study relationships among environmental and biological variables. However, 
ubiquitously used approaches to studying such relationships, based on correlation and regression, 
provide only a small slice of the complex information contained in the relationships. Other 
statistical approaches exist that provide a complete description of relationships between variables, 
based on the concept of the *copula*; they are applied in finance, neuroscience and other fields, 
but not in ecology. We here explore the concepts that underpin copulas and examine the potential 
for those concepts to improve our understanding of ecology. We find that informative copula 
structure in dependencies between variables is exceedingly common across all the environmental, 
species-trait, phenological, population, community, and ecosystem functioning datasets we 
considered. Many datasets exhibited asymmetric tail dependence, whereby two variables are more 
strongly related in their left compared to right tails, or vice versa. We describe mechanisms by which 
observed copula structure and tail dependence can arise in ecological data, including a Moran-like 
effect whereby dependence structures between environmental variables are inherited by ecological 
variables; and asymmetric or nonlinear influences of environments on ecological variables, such as 
under Liebig's law of the minimum. Copula structure and tail 
dependence can also reveal causal relationships between variables. We describe consequences of copula structure, including impacts 
on extinction risk and the stability through time of ecosystem services. By documenting the 
importance of a complete description of dependence, advancing conceptual frameworks, and 
demonstrating a powerful approach, we aim to elevate copula reasoning to widespread use in ecology.

# Introduction\label{Intro}

All branches of ecology 
study relationships among environmental and biological 
variables. However, commonly used correlation and regression 
approaches to studying 
such relationships are limited, and 
provide only a partial description of a relationship between variables. 
For instance, datasets showing markedly different 
relationships may have the same correlation coefficient
(Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}A-B). The variables of Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}A 
(respectively, Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}B) are principally 
related in the left (respectively, right) portions of their distributions, 
an asymmetric pattern of dependence that can
have profound significance, as discussed below, but is not captured by 
correlation. 
Monotonic transformations can alter the Pearson, but not the Spearman
correlation (Appendix \ref{SM-pedagog1_details}, 
Fig. \ref{SM-fig_transf_pearson_spearman}). Although correlation
is only one way to 
study relationships between variables, other common metrics also 
provide partial information.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Well-developed approaches do exist, however, and are 
applied widely in other fields, 
that provide a description of the dependence 
between two or more variables that can be mathematically proven 
to be complete [@joe2014_dependence; @nelsen2006_copula]. 
The approaches are based on 
the concept of the *copula*, which we here 
introduce. Copula approaches separate the information of a bivariate 
random variable into two distinct parts: the information in the 
marginal distributions (which says nothing about the dependence between the 
variables), and the remaining information (which is solely about
the dependence). From a data perspective, given 
a sample $(x_i,y_i)$, $i=1,2,\ldots,n$ (e.g., 
Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}A-B), the dependence
structure is revealed by the bivariate plot of $u_i$ versus $v_i$, where
$u_i$ is the rank of $x_i$ in the set $x_j$ ($j=1,\ldots,n$), divided by
$n+1$; and $v_i$ is defined in the same way but using the $y_i$. The rank
of the smallest element in a set is $1$. The $u_i$ and 
$v_i$ are called *normalized ranks* of the $x_i$ and $y_i$. See, 
for instance,
Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}C-D (the points), which show the copula structures of 
A-B, respectively. Ranking makes the marginal distributions of 
the underlying random variables uniform, isolating the 
dependence structure.
See @nelsen2006_copula and @joe2014_dependence
for general background. A theorem of @sklar1959_theorem
states that copulas give a unique and complete 
representation of the dependence
between variables.

A main benefit of a copula approach is 
that it can sensitively detect tail dependence and asymmetries of tail dependence. 
Tail dependence is association between extreme values of variables. 
If smaller values of two positively associated variables are more 
strongly associated than are larger values, the variables are said to
have stronger lower- or left-tail dependence than right- or upper-tail dependence
(Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}A, C);
and \emph{vice versa} if larger values are more strongly associated than smaller
ones (Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}B, D). Datasets of the same 
correlation can have a range of tail dependence 
(Fig. \ref{SM-fig_cop_pedag}), which can be quantified (see section on
methods for the observational hypothesis).

The goal of this paper is to illustrate the potential for 
applications of copulas in ecology. 
Our results provide initial support for the following 
overall hypothesis: environmental, ecological and evolutionary processes 
generate and transmit copula structure and tail dependence, with substantial 
consequences for theoretical and conceptual understanding, for inference, and for 
applications across ecology. This is a broad hypothesis, and 
even the substantial empirical and theoretical
evidence we present here has only begun to test it. So we hope our work stimulates further
evaluation of the hypothesis by the research community.
We examine our overall hypothesis by assessing several more specific 
hypotheses, described below and outlined in Fig. 
\ref{MasterFigure}, all of which bear upon the overall hypothesis. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=7in]{./MasterFigure.pdf}
\caption{Guide for hypotheses addressed in the text and how each instantiates the
overall hypothesis. Labels are defined 
in the text to refer to parts of the figure. "Causal hypotheses" (i.e., hypotheses about 
causes of copula structure) are labeled with letters A-D. "Consequential 
hypothesis" (i.e., hypothesis about 
consequences of copula structure) are labeled with X-Z. The "observational 
hypothesis" (i.e., our hypothesis about 
copula structure of data) is labeled O.\label{MasterFigure}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

One way we may expect a copula approach 
to better reflect ecological relationships relates to Liebig's law of the
minimum. If, for instance, the growth of a plant depends on soil 
nitrogen, N, and other factors, a plot of plant growth rates versus N may 
look more like Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}A or E than like 
Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}B or F. Nitrogen 
will control plant growth, producing a clear
relationship, only when it is limiting, in the left portions of the distributions. 
The portions of the distributions that dominate the association is visible in the copula
approach, but not via standard techniques. We therefore frame "causal hypothesis" A 
(labeled in Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}): 
copulas of dependencies between environmental and 
ecological variables will sensitively reveal 
nonlinear, asymmetric and threshold effects for population, community, 
and ecosystem functioning variables; copulas between 
environmental and ecological variables
will commonly show tail dependence; such tail dependence will lead to 
tail dependence across space in ecological variables.

A second reason we may expect a copula approach to benefit ecological
research is that prior work has demonstrated important copula 
stucture in the spatial dependence of environmental 
variables [@Serinaldi2008; @She2018; @Goswami2018;
@li2013]. One may expect copula structure in environmental variables 
to take the form of strong tail dependence if
intense meteorological events are also widespread in their effects, as seems 
frequently to be the case.
Spatial dependence in an environmental variable 
tends to beget spatial dependence 
in fluctuations of populations or other ecosystem variables 
(this is called \emph{spatial synchrony}) which are influenced by the environmental 
variable. This is called the \emph{Moran effect}. 
If copula structure is transmitted, 
possibly in modified form, 
from environmental to ecological variables, then we may expect important 
copula structure to be a common feature of the spatial synchrony of population, community, 
biogeochemical and other ecological variables.
Synchrony is a phenomenon of great interest in 
ecology [@Liebhold2004; @Sheppard2016; @walteretal2017]. We therefore frame 
causal hypothesis B (again labeled in Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}): Moran effects
transmit copula structure in spatial dependence from environmental to 
ecological variables, and hence copula structure and tail dependence will be 
common features of spatial synchrony in ecological variables. 

A third reason we may expect a copula approach to benefit 
ecological research is that such an approach may help illuminate 
the causal mechanisms between variables. For instance, if two species
Sp1 and Sp2 are strong competitors, abundances of the two species
across quadrats should be negatively related, as in 
Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}E-F. If Sp1 is plotted on the horizontal axis
and Sp2 on the vertical, then Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}E 
would suggest Sp1 is the dominant 
competitor: when Sp1 is abundant, Sp2 is necessarily rare because it is suppressed; 
whereas when Sp1 is rare, Sp2
may be abundant, or may also be relatively rare due to 
limiting factors other than Sp1. 
Alternatively, Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}F suggests that Sp2
is dominant. The copula approach again reveals which portions of the
distributions are principally responsible for the association between variables, and this 
information can help support or refute alternative causal hypotheses. We
frame causal hypothesis C (Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}): copulas of abundances
through time or space of two competing or otherwise interacting species will
reflect any asymmetries in the interaction. We will later
frame causal hypothesis D, which concerns character evolution.

Another reason we may expect copula structure to be important
in ecology has to do with spatially aggregated or averaged quantities. 
Many ecological variables of applied importance 
depend on the spatial average or sum of local 
quantities. For instance, regional methane and CO$_2$ 
fluxes are the sum of local fluxes; 
and the total economic value of a fishery is the sum of local catches. 
We therefore frame "consequential hypothesis" X (labeled on Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}):
details, revealed by copulas, of the 
dependence between local quantities can influence the spatial 
mean or sum, and this may influence higher organizational levels in 
ecology and human concerns.
Illustrating the idea here, prior work demonstrated that the overall 
reliability of wind-generated electricity depends sensitively on details
of the dependence between wind speeds at multiple generator sites [@li2013]. 
Spatially aggregated ecological variables may show a similar dependence, with
potentially substantial consequences. For instance, if populations of a 
pest species in different locations are all positively associated and also strongly
related to each other in their right tails, then local outbreaks will tend 
to occur together, creating regional epidemics. 
On the other hand left-tail dependence in a pest species, even if overall 
correlation were unchanged, would have more benign effects. We will
later frame consequential hypotheses Y, about extinction risk, and Z, about Taylor's law.

Our causal and consequential hypotheses imply, or rely on, an "observational
hypothesis" (O in Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}), which we here frame: datasets in 
ecology will commonly have copula structure
distinct from that of a Gaussian/normal distribution (here called 
non-normal copula structure); they will commonly show tail dependence 
distinct from that of a normal distribution; in particular they will
show asymmetric tail dependence.

Because the observational hypothesis bears upon all the causal
and consequential hypotheses, we test it first, in sections 2-4 of the paper.
We analyze several datasets, including 
environmental, species-trait, phenological, population, community, and 
ecosystem functioning data, selected to span multiple 
sub-fields and organizational levels of ecology. 
Sections 5 and 6 test the causal hypotheses, and sections 7 and 8 test the
consequential hypotheses. Section 9 is the Discussion.
Copula approaches have been used to great effect in neuroscience [@onken2009], 
bioinformatics [@Kim2008], medical research [@Emura2016], direct study of environmental 
variables [@Serinaldi2008; @She2018; @Goswami2018; @li2013], and finance [@Li2000]. 
To our knowledge, these concepts have never been used in ecology. 
We argue that benefits to ecology of using a complete 
copula description of dependence will be substantial.

Datasets included environmental, species-trait, phenological, 
population, community, and ecosystem functioning data (Table \ref{tab_data_info}). Copula structure describing 
the relationship between atmospheric weather variables such as rainfall or wind speed 
as measured in multiple locations has been 
examined previously in the meteorological literature [e.g., @Serinaldi2008; @li2013]. We therefore 
examined environmental variables from the soil instead, using the Rapid Carbon 
Assessment database [RaCA; @Wills2014].
<!--***DAN: Add Wills and Loecke pending reference if published in time--> 
The database comprises measurements of soil organic carbon and total soil 
nitrogen (Mg C or N per hectare of soil surface) from `r nrow(d_soilCN)` 
locations across the coterminous United States (Fig. \ref{SM-fig_SoilCNmapUSA} for sampling locations).
Species-trait data were average species basal metabolic rate (BMR, KJ per hour) and 
body mass (grams) for `r nrow(d_birdsBMR)`  species of birds [@Mcnab_2009] 
and `r nrow(d_mammalsBMR)`  species of mammals [@Mcnab_2008].
These data have been much studied, but to our knowledge the copula structure 
of the dependence between metabolic rate and body mass has not been examined. 
Species-trait data such as these reflect the coevolution of the two traits.
Phenological data were aphid first-flight dates from 10 locations (Fig. \ref{SM-fig_aphid_map}) 
across the United Kingdom (UK) for 20 aphid species (Table \ref{SM-tab_aphid_info}), for the 
35 years 1976 to 2010. These time series were computed from the Rothamsted Insect 
Survey (RIS) suction-trap dataset [@Harrington2014; @Bell2015]. The first of our two 
population-level datasets was also derived from the RIS suction-trap data, and comprised 
total counts of aphids trapped for the same locations, species, and years. 
Our second population dataset comprised average annual plankton abundance estimates 
for 14 locations (Fig. \ref{SM-fig_plankton_map})
in the North Sea and British seas for 22 taxa (Table \ref{SM-tab_plankton_info}) for the 
56 years 1958 to 2013. The locations are $2^\circ$ by $2^\circ$ grid cells. 
Community-level data, obtained from the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, were 
plant aboveground biomass [@ccdataple120] and Shannon's diversity index (computed from plant 
species percent cover data [@ccdatapce120]) for `r nrow(d_cc[[5]])` plots [@ccdataplotse120], 
each 9m by 9m, as sampled in the years 1996-2000 and 2007, each year 
analyzed separately [@Tilman2001; @Tilman2006]. 
Finally, ecosystem functioning data were methane (CH$_{4}$) fluxes between the soil or 
water surface and the troposphere, measured at 13 locations at daily to weekly intervals 
from September 2015 to September 2016 at the Great Miami Wetland mitigation bank in Trotwood, 
Ohio [@Holland1999; @Jarecke2016; @smyth2019using]. Each included location was measured on at least 50 dates. See Appendix \ref{SM-Data_details} for additional data details. 

The environmental, species-trait, and community datasets are henceforth 
called the "bivariate" datasets in the sense that they comprise two quantities measured at 
different locations or for different species (Table \ref{tab_data_info}). 
The phenology, population, and ecosystem functioning datasets are 
"multivariate" in that they comprise, for each taxon, measurements through time at multiple locations; 
copula structure can be studied for each pair of locations.

# Background, concepts and methods for testing the observational hypothesis\label{Methods} 

Conceptually, a bivariate copula is a random variable 
on the unit square, $[0,1] \times [0,1]$, with uniform maginals. 
If $(X,Y)$ is a continuous random
variable and the cummulative distribution functions of $X$ and $Y$ are 
$F_X(x)=P[X\leq x]$ and $F_Y(y)=P[Y\leq y]$, then the dependence structure
of $(X,Y)$ is revealed by the random variable $(F_X(X),F_Y(Y))$,
which takes values in $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ and has 
uniform marginals. 
We introduce the copula families we used, and 
measures of tail dependence.
The normal copula family (henceforth N) is a one-parameter
family, with parameter corresponding to the correlation of the related 
bivariate normal distribtion, and controlling the degree of dependence 
(Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}G for an example).
Left- and right-tail dependence are $0$ for the N copula, and this 
serves as a benchmark for tail dependence in other copulas - positive values of our
tail dependence measures correspond to dependence stronger than an N
copula. The Clayton and 
survival-Clayton families (Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}C-D) are two more one-parameter 
families. The Clayton has positive lower-tail dependence ($0.87$ for
the example of Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}C) and $0$ upper-tail dependence; the 
survival-Clayton is a rotation of the Clayton by $180^\circ$ and has 
positive upper-tail ($0.87$ in Fig. \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}D)
and $0$ lower-tail dependence. For our model selection procedure (see below), we used 
several families of copulas exhibiting various 
lower- and upper-tail dependence characteristics 
(Clayton, survival-Clayton, Gumbel, survival-Gumbel, Joe, survival-Joe, Frank,
BB1, survival-BB1,
BB6, survival-BB6, BB7, survival-BB7, BB8, survival-BB8, henceforth
abbreviated C, SC, G, SG, J, SJ, F, BB1, SBB1, BB6, SBB6, BB7, SBB7, BB8, SBB8).
Copulas are implemented in the R packages `copula` and `VineCopula`. 
Visualizations are in 
Figs \ref{SM-figped_N}-\ref{SM-figped_SBB8}. 
If LT and UT denote 
lower- and upper-tail dependence measures, their difference measures asymmetry of 
tail dependence.
See @nelsen2006_copula, @joe2014_dependence for further background. 

We tested the observational hypothesis (Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}, O) 
principally via a model selection procedure in which the 
copulas listed above were fitted to 
our ecological datasets and fits were compared via the Akaike and Bayesian 
Information Criteria (AIC and BIC). For bivariate datasets 
$(x_i,y_i)$ for $i=1,...,n$, model selection involved several steps. 
First, we produced normalized ranks 
$u_i$ and $v_i$ as in the Introduction. 
Second, we tested the independence of the $u_i$ and $v_i$ 
(using `BiCopIndTest` in the `VineCopula` package). 
Our model 
selection algorithms were ineffective if data could not be distinguished from independent data 
since many of the copula families we considered include the independent copula. 
If independence could be rejected ($0.05$ significance level), model 
selection proceeded. Third, we fit the 16 bivariate copula families listed previously to the 
normalized ranks via maximum likelihood, using `BiCopEst` in `VineCopula`, 
then obtaining AIC and BIC values and accompanying model weights $\text{AIC}_{\text{w}}$ and 
$\text{BIC}_{\text{w}}$ [@burnham2003_modelselection]. `BiCopEst` also provided the lower- and 
upper-tail dependence of the best-fitting member of each family. 
Fourth, $\text{AIC}_{\text{w}}$ values were used to get
model-averaged lower- and upper-tail dependence values using standard model averaging 
formulas [@burnham2003_modelselection]; likewise for BIC.
Model selection methods give the *relative* support of several models, but do not 
indicate whether any of the models are an objectively good fit. To test that, 
and as our final step, we tested the goodness of fit of our AIC-best copula family using a 
bootstrapping procedure (`BiCopGofTest` of `VineCopula`). The procedure performed 
one test based on a Cramer-von Mises statistic and another based on a 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. To keep computation times reasonable, 
an initial run using $100$ bootstraps was performed; if
the $p$-value from either test was less than $0.2$, tests were re-run with 
$1000$ boostraps.

The first part of the observational hypothesis was tested for a bivariate dataset 
by comparing the AIC weights of the non-N copula
families with that of the N family. 
The second part was tested by comparing 
the model-averaged lower- and upper-tail dependence
values to the lower- and upper-tail dependence values of an N copula (i.e., 0). 
The third part 
was tested by comparing the difference of the model-averaged lower- and upper-tail 
dependence values to the analogous difference for an N copula, again 0.
For multivariate datasets, we carried out the bivariate analysis
for all possible pairwise combinations of locations, and 
compared AIC weights and tail-dependence of 
minimum-AIC copulas with that of an N copula. We also counted the number of location pairs 
for which model-averaged lower-tail dependence was 
greater than model-averaged upper-tail dependence 
or vice-versa, and reported the percentage of non-independent 
location pairs showing stronger lower-tail dependence.

In addition to our model selection approach, we also used nonparametric approaches to 
provide greater 
confidence in our tests of the observational hypothesis. We used three 
statistics which quantify the extent to which 
the normalized ranks $u_i$ and $v_i$ are 
related in any part of their distributions; we here describe the 
statistics conceptually, with details in Appendix \ref{SM-nonparam_stats}.
The statistics are defined with positively associated
variables in mind. All our variables were positively associated
when they were significantly associated.
Given two bounds 
$0 \leq l_b < u_b \leq 1$, define the lines $u+v=2l_b$ and 
$u+v=2u_b$, which intersect the unit square (Figs \ref{fig_cop_pedag1}H, 
\ref{SM-fig_stat_image}). 
Our statistics quantify the dependence
between $u_i$ and $v_i$ in the region bounded by these lines.
Using $l_b=0$ and $u_b\leq 0.5$ gives information about 
dependence in the left parts of the distributions of $u$ and $v$, and 
using $u_b=1$ and $l_b \geq 0.5$ gives information about dependence in 
the right parts. The first statistic, 
$\cor_{l_b,u_b}(u,v)$, is the portion of the Spearman 
correlation of $u_i$ and $v_i$ that is attributable to the points 
between the bounds.
Larger values indicate stronger positive association.
We also defined a statistic $\Ps_{l_b,u_b}$ (Appendix \ref{SM-nonparam_stats}), 
which has a similar 
interpretation to $\cor_{l_{b},u_{b}}(u,v)$.
Our third statistic, $\Dsq_{l_b,u_b}(u,v)$, is the average squared 
distance between points satisfying $u_i+v_i>2l_b$ and 
$u_i+v_i<2u_b$ and the line $v=u$.
Unlike $\cor_{l_b,u_b}$ and 
$\Ps_{l_b,u_b}$, for which large values inidicate strong dependence
between the bounds, small values of 
$\Dsq_{l_b,u_b}$ indicate strong dependence. 

For large datasets (large $n$),
we used $l_b$ and $u_b$ close together without incurring undue
sampling variation in our statistics, and we considered 
multiple bands $(l_b,u_b)$ to understand how dependence
varies in different parts of the distributions. But for datasets with 
smaller $n$ we considered only $l_b=0$, $u_b=0.5$ and $l_b=0.5$, $u_b=1$,
abbreviating $\cor_l=\cor_{0,0.5}$ ($l$ is for "lower") 
and $\cor_u=\cor_{0.5,1}$ ($u$ is for "upper"). Likewise $\Ps_l=\Ps_{0,.5}$,
$\Ps_u=\Ps_{0.5,1}$, $\Dsq_l=\Dsq_{0,0.5}$, $\Dsq_u=\Dsq_{0.5,1}$.

To test for asymmetry of dependence in upper and lower portions of distributions,
we used differences $\cor_l-\cor_u$, $\Ps_l-\Ps_u$ and $\Dsq_u-\Dsq_l$
for smaller datasets, (note the opposite order
in the last of these); and $\cor_{0,u_b}-\cor_{1-u_b,1}$, 
$\Ps_{0,u_b}-\Ps_{1-u_b,1}$ and
$\Dsq_{1-u_b,1}-\Dsq_{0,u_b}$ with $u_b$ close 
to $0$ for large datasets.
We tested our statistics in Appendix \ref{SM-Test_npa_stat} (see also Figs \ref{SM-fig_stat_testing35}-\ref{SM-fig_stat_testing1000}). Code and data for this
project is archived at \url{www.github.com/sghosh89/BIVAN}.

Across essentially all our datasets, copula structures were typically non-N and 
commonly showed asymmetric tail 
dependence: the observational hypothesis was supported (Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}). To make results easier to absorb, we first 
present results for an example bivariate dataset, then we summarize results
for all bivariate datasets, then we present results for an example multivariate dataset, then we summarize for all multivariate datasets.

<!--bivariate example-->
For the soil C and N data (Data, Table \ref{tab_data_info}, 
Fig. \ref{fig_biv_multi_raw_cop}A,E), variables were 
non-independent ($p=$ `r BivMS_res_Loecke$IndepTestRes`, to within the precision available 
from `BiCopIndTest` in the `VineCopula` package); non-independence is also visually apparent.
The Kendall correlation was `r round(BivMS_res_Loecke$TauVal,2)`. We fitted our 16 copulas
to the data and computed AIC and BIC weights and corresponding
lower- and upper-tail statistics for the fitted distributions (Table \ref{SM-tab_soilCNfit}).
`r BivMS_res_Loecke$InfCritRes$copname[which.max(BivMS_res_Loecke$InfCritRes$AICw)]` was the 
minimum-AIC copula, with AIC weight `r round(max(BivMS_res_Loecke$InfCritRes$AICw),2)`, whereas the 
N copula had AIC weight essentially 0, confirming the 
first part of the observational hypothesis for these data. 
Model-averaged lower- and upper-tail dependence statistics were `r round(BivMS_res_Loecke$relLTdep_AICw,3)` 
and `r round(BivMS_res_Loecke$relUTdep_AICw,3)`, respectively (AIC weights were used for averaging). 
These values are distinct from what an N copula would give, namely, 0, confirming the second part 
of the observational hypothesis. The values also differed substantially 
from each other, confirming the third part of the observational hypothesis. 
The numbers reflect stronger upper- than lower-tail
dependence, and this is also visible in the extreme upper-right
and lower-left corners of the copula plot (Fig. \ref{fig_biv_multi_raw_cop}E).

Although these results convincingly show non-N copula structure, 
we caution that the model-averaged tail-dependence statistics may have been biased 
because even the lowest-AIC copula 
(`r BivMS_res_Loecke$InfCritRes$copname[which.max(BivMS_res_Loecke$InfCritRes$AICw)]`) 
was a poor fit ($p=$ `r BivMS_res_Loecke$GofRes_CvM` and `r BivMS_res_Loecke$GofRes_KS` for the 
Cramer-von Mises and Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit tests, respectively, to within the precision 
available from `BiCopGofTest`). However, nonparametric statistics verified
both that tail dependence was distinct from that of an N copula, and that it 
was asymmetric (Appendices \ref{SM-Q1bivarnonparam}, \ref{SM-surrog_test}, 
Fig. \ref{SM-fig_soilCN_nonparam}, Table \ref{SM-tab_soilCN_asym}). 

<!--bivariate summary-->
Table \ref{tab_bivar_summary} summarizes results of testing the observational hypothesis 
using the bivariate datasets. The two 
variables were significantly related for all datasets 
(Table \ref{tab_bivar_summary}, row 1). A non-N copula 
always emerged as the lowest-AIC (highest-AIC-weight) copula 
(Table \ref{tab_bivar_summary}, row 2). 
The N copula was always a poor fit compared to the highest-AIC-weight copula 
(Table \ref{tab_bivar_summary}, rows 3-4), confirming 
the first part of the observational hypothesis. 
Lower- and upper-tail dependence statistics often differed substantially from 0 
(Table \ref{tab_bivar_summary}, rows 7-8) and from each other (Table \ref{tab_bivar_summary}, row 9), 
confirming the second and third parts of the observational hypothesis. 
The first three datasets had stronger upper- 
than lower-tail dependence, and the last dataset had the reverse, though weakly. 
Although these results convincingly show non-N copula structure, the 
model-averaged tail-dependence statistics may have been biased 
because even the lowest-AIC copula was a poor fit in some cases 
(Table \ref{tab_bivar_summary}, rows 5-6).
But our nonparametric statistics confirmed the same conclusions 
(Appendices \ref{SM-Q1bivarnonparam}, \ref{SM-surrog_test}).
We did the same analysis 
with Cedar Creek data from other available years, 1996-1999 and 2007. For 1996 and 
2007, biomass and Shannon's index were independent; for 1997-1999, results 
were similar to 2000: the best-fitting copula was not N, and there was slightly stronger lower- 
than upper-tail dependence. Detailed results for each dataset are in 
Tables \ref{SM-tab_soilCNfit} - \ref{SM-tab_cc_asym_2000} and 
Figs. \ref{SM-fig_soilCN_nonparam} - \ref{SM-fig_cc2000_nonparam}. 

We present green spruce aphid abundance (Table \ref{tab_data_info}) results
as an example multivariate analysis.
Independence was rejected for each pair of the 10 sampling locations. 
Best-fitting (lowest-AIC) copulas were non-N
for the large majority of location pairs (Table \ref{SM-tab_count_bestcop}), and 
AIC weights for best-fitting copulas (Table \ref{SM-tab_count_AICw}) 
were typically substantially 
larger than N-copula weights (Table \ref{SM-tab_count_AICw_normal}), confirming 
the first part of the observational hypothesis. Goodness of fit tests 
(Tables \ref{SM-tab_count_p_CvM}, \ref{SM-tab_count_p_KS}) in every case 
failed to reject the hypothesis that the AIC-best copula family was also 
an objectively adequate description of 
the data; the collection of 
copula families we used was sufficiently broad to characterize these data.
Model-averaged lower- (Table \ref{SM-tab_count_LTdep_AICw}) and upper-tail
(Table \ref{SM-tab_count_UTdep_AICw}) dependence statistics were exclusively 
positive and were frequently large, thereby differing 
from what an N copula would give (i.e., 0), and confirming the second part of 
the observational hypothesis. These data have greater tail dependence 
(lower and upper) than would be expected from an N-copula null hypothesis. 
Model-averaged lower- minus upper-tail dependence statistics 
(Table \ref{SM-tab_count_LTmUT}) were positive 
for all but a few location pairs (`r sum((RES_aphid_count$LTdep_AICw-RES_aphid_count$UTdep_AICw)>0,na.rm=T)` 
out of `r (dim(RES_aphid_count$gfc_p_CvM)[1]^2-dim(RES_aphid_count$gfc_p_CvM)[1])-2*RES_aphid_count$num_indep_loc_pair`). Thus the spatial synchrony of rarity in the green spruce aphid is stronger 
than the spatial synchrony of outbreaks. This also confirms the third part of the 
observational hypothesis.
Nonparametric statistics verified that tail dependence was asymmetric for the green 
spruce aphid abundance data (Appendix \ref{SM-Q1multvarnonparam}, \ref{SM-spatial_resamp}).

<!--multivariate summary-->
Table \ref{tab_multivar_summary} summarizes results of testing the observational hypothesis for
multivariate data. Results supported the 
conclusions that non-N copula structure, non-N tail dependence, and asymmetric tail 
dependence were common, supporting the observational hypothesis. 
Most location pairs were non-independent 
(Table \ref{tab_multivar_summary}, row 2). The large majority of non-independent location 
pairs had best-fitting copulas that were not the N copula (Table \ref{tab_multivar_summary}, 
row 3), and AIC weights of best-fitting copulas were 
better than those of N copulas (Table \ref{tab_multivar_summary}, rows 4-5).
Best-fitting copulas were nearly always considered an adequate fit 
(Table \ref{tab_multivar_summary}, row 6). Some of the datasets (green spruce aphid
abundance, \textit{Ceratium furca} abundance, methane-flux) showed stronger 
or marginally stronger lower- than upper-tail dependence 
(Table \ref{tab_multivar_summary}, rows 7-9), whereas leaf-curling plum aphid first flight
data showed the reverse. Asymmetry results were verified by nonparametric approaches 
<!--(e.g., Table \ref{tab_multivar_summary}, row 10)-->
(Appendix \ref{SM-Q1multvarnonparam}, \ref{SM-spatial_resamp}). Detailed results are in 
Tables \ref{SM-tab_count_bestcop}-\ref{SM-tab_methane_resamp} and 
Figs \ref{SM-fig_aphid_count}-\ref{SM-fig_methane}.
We also carried out the same analyses for abundance and first-flight data for the 18 
aphid species for which we had data other than the green spruce and leaf-curling plum aphids,
as well as for the 21 plankton taxa for which we had abundance data other than the
\textit{Ceratium furca} (results not shown); conclusions supported that 
non-N copula structure and tail dependence and asymmetry of tail dependence are 
common.

# Background, concepts and methods for testing the causal hypotheses \label{Causes}

Having demonstrated that non-N copula structure and asymmetric tail dependence are 
common, we addressed the causal hypotheses (Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}, A-D)
using models. We did not systematically 
test the first two parts of A 
because nonlinear and thresold effects of 
environmental variables on ecological variables are already well documented 
(however, see Discussion material about the green spruce aphid). To test 
the third part of hypothesis A, we formulated a model in which 
an environmental variable influences an ecological variable
more strongly in one of its tails, and explored whether the ecological variable
could then exhibit asymmetric tail dependence across space.
Let $E_i(t)$ be an ecological variable 
measured at location $i$ ($i=1,2$) at time $t$.
Assume the dynamics 
$E_i(t+1)=bE_i(t)+g(\epsilon_i(t))+a \delta_i(t)$, where 
the $\delta_i(t)$ are standard-normally distributed 
and independent across time and locations, $a=0.2$,
$b=0.1, -0.1, 0.5, -0.5$ in different simulations, and 
the $(\epsilon_1(t),\epsilon_2(t))$ were drawn, independently through
time, from a bivariate normal distribution with $\var(\epsilon_i)=1$ and 
$\cov(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2)=0.8$.
The function $g$ describes how the environment $\epsilon_i(t)$ influences
$E_i(t)$. We used $g$ equal to $g_1$ or $g_2$ in different simulations:
$g_1(\epsilon)$ equals $\epsilon$ if $\epsilon<0$ and $0$ otherwise;
$g_2(\epsilon)$ equals $\epsilon$ if $\epsilon>0$ and $0$ otherwise. Thus
$g_1$ represents environmental effects that occur only for negative 
values and $g_2$ only for positive values of $\epsilon$.
Negative values of $b$ correspond to overcompensating dynamics 
and positive values to undercompensating dynamics; larger $|b|$
means slower return to equilibrium after a disturbance. 
Because $(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2)$
and $(\delta_1,\delta_2)$ have N copula structure, the Moran 
mechanism analyzed below (B on Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}) 
does not operate here.

For each $b$ and $g_i$, we simulated the model for $25000$ time
steps and retained the $E_i(t)$ for the final $2500$ time 
steps. We applied our model selection algorithms and 
non-parametric statistics (methods for the observational hypothesis) to these 
outputs to discover if the model could
produce non-N copula structure and asymmetric tail dependence in the 
$E_i(t)$.

Hypothesis B is an extension of the well known Moran
effect, and was summarized conceptually in the Introduction. 
Let $E_i(t)$ again be an ecological variable, $i=1,2$.
We initially assume the AR(1) dynamics 
$E_i(t+1)=\beta E_{i}(t)+ \sqrt{1-\beta^2} \epsilon_i(t)$, with $\beta=0.5$. 
The environmental noises $\epsilon_i(t)$ are 
standard-normal random variables that are independent for distinct times, $t$, but 
exhibited different kinds of 
dependence across locations in different simulations (see below).
The variable $E$ is very general, and could represent deviations
of a population density from a carrying capacity, deviations of
total plant community biomass from an average value,
flux of a biogeochemical variable such as methane, or other quantities.

To explore the importance of nonlinear dynamics for hypothesis B, we also considered 
nonlinear population models based on $P_i(t+1)=P_i(t)\exp \left(r\left(1-P_i(t)/K  \right) \right)+\sigma\epsilon_i(t))$, using $r=0.5$, $K=100$, and $\sigma=0.1$ or 
$\sigma=1$. When $\sigma=0.1$, population dynamics stay close to the carrying capacity, 
$K$, and the nonlinearities of the model have limited influence on dynamics. When
$\sigma=1$, model dynamics are strongly nonlinear. We refer to these as
the weak-noise and strong-noise cases, though the importance of the noise here
is that, when it is strong, it brings the nonlinearities of the model into play. 

For each of the three model setups above, for each of several copula families, for each $\tau=0.1,0.2,\ldots,0.9$, and for each of
$50$ replicate simulations, we generated 5000 noise pairs 
$(\epsilon_1(t),\epsilon_2(t))$ from the
bivariate random variable with the given copula family and the given $\tau$.
We then used this noise to drive the model, and retained both the
noise and population values for the final 500 
time steps. For each simulation, the following
statistics were computed for both noises and populations: 
Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlations, $\cor_l$, $\cor_u$, $\Ps_l$, $\Ps_u$, 
$\Dsq_l$, $\Dsq_u$, $\cor_l - \cor_u$, $\Ps_l - \Ps_u$, and $\Dsq_u - \Dsq_l$. 
Values were plotted against $\tau$ for noises and populations. If causal hypothesis B is
correct, plots should be similar for populations and noises. 

Hypothesis C was not tested. Our next 
causal hypothesis, D on Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}, 
is evolutionary, and pertains to bivariate 
trait data across species, e.g., our bird and mammal 
data. This mechanism is a hypothetical explanation for the right tail dependence
observed in those data (Fig. \ref{fig_biv_multi_raw_cop}F,G). 
The hypothesis is that tail dependence occurs in evolutionary changes
in bivariate characters, and gives rise to tail dependence in observed character values
across extant species.
We simulated bivariate character evolution on an estimate of 
the phylogeny, taken from @GenoudIM2018, of $817$ mammal species.
The root character state and the change 
across each branch were randomly chosen from matrices of one million 
bivariate draws from distributions showing one of five distinct types of copula 
structure: 1) extreme or 2) moderate left-tail dependence,
3) symmetric tail dependence, or 4) moderate or 5) extreme
right-tail dependence (Appendix \ref{SM-evol_mech}). 
All distributions had standard-normal marginals and Spearman 
correlation $0.875$ between components, so our simulations assess 
the impact of copula structure only. For each of the five copulas, mammalian character
evolution was simulated 100 times. For each simulation, symmetry of tail dependence 
of the two characters across phylogeny tips was assessed.
We hypothesized that cases 1 and 2 above would yield stronger left- than right-tail 
dependence in tip characters, and cases 4 and 5 would yield the reverse. 
The simulator was written in Python and used version 4.4 of the DendroPy 
package [@DendroPy]. 

# Results of testing the causal hypotheses: Moran effects and asymmetric dependencies produce non-normal copula structure\label{Results_Q2}

could produce outputs with visually apparent asymmetry 
of tail dependence, to an extent that depended on the value of $b$,
thus confirming the third part of hypothesis A for our model. 
For $b=0.1$ (Fig. \ref{fig_ms_asym_b_0.1}) and $b=-0.1$ (Fig. \ref{SM-fig_ms_asym_b_-0.1}), 
for both $g_1$ and $g_2$,
asymmetry of tail dependence was strong; for 
$b=\pm 0.5$, asymmetry was weaker but still apparent
(Figs \ref{SM-fig_ms_asym_b_0.5} - 
\ref{SM-fig_ms_asym_b_-0.5}).
Lower-tail (respectively, upper-tail) spatial dependence in 
effects of noise ($g_1$, respectively, $g_2$) 
produced lower-tail (respectively, upper-tail) spatial dependence in the ecological variable.
Model selection results (Table \ref{SM-tab_summary_stat_asym_sens}) confirmed that
ecological outputs had non-N copula structure, but did not always reflect 
asymmetry of tail dependence, perhaps because those methods measured
dependence in the extreme tails. Results using our nonparametric statistics, however,
reflected the visually apparent asymmetry (Tables \ref{SM-tab_stat_npa_asym}).

Causal hypothesis B (Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}) was largely confirmed; 
however, similarities between environmental- and 
ecological-variable copula structure were reduced when dynamics were strongly nonlinear.
For simulations using AR(1) models, copula 
statistics were always very similar for noise and populations 
(Fig \ref{fig_Cause4copula_scatter_C_kend_ar1}, 
\ref{SM-fig_Cause4copula_C_kend_ar1}-\ref{SM-fig_Cause4copula_SJ_kend_ar1}),
though there were significant but minor differences for some statistics
and simulations.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

For weak noise and our nonlinear model, copula statistics
were again very similar for noise and model outputs 
(Figs \ref{SM-fig_Cause4copula_C_kend_sRicker_nsd_0.1}-
\ref{SM-fig_Cause4copula_SJ_kend_sRicker_nsd_1}).
Though there were again significant but small differences for some statistics
and simulations, the hypothesis was supported that copula structure in the noise translates
to similar but not identical copula structure in output populations. 
Since many ecological models are nonlinear, this result provides the 
expectation that there will be a Moran-effect-like correspondence 
between noise and model-output copula structure for typical ecological dynamics,
as long as noise is small enough that dynamics stay relatively close
to the model equilibrium. Results that hold for "weak noise" in this sense
are common in ecology. 
We repeated the analysis with $r=1.3$, with similar results. The deterministic 
one-habitat-patch Ricker model exhibits a monotonic approach to a stable equilibrium
at $K$ when $r<1$ (undercompensating dynamics, e.g., the value $r=0.5$ used initially), 
but exhibits an oscillatory approach to $K$ when $r>1$ (overcompensating
dynamics, e.g., $r=1.3$).

For strong noise and using our nonlinear model, 
copula statistics, generally speaking, were approximately similar 
between noise and model
outputs; however, similarity was reduced relative to previous results, 
and for a few simulations, tail dependence asymmetry statistics
even had opposite signs for noise and model outputs 
(Figs \ref{SM-fig_Cause4copula_C_kend_sRicker_nsd_0.1}-\ref{SM-fig_Cause4copula_SJ_kend_sRicker_nsd_1}). For instance, using a C copula with a large Kendall $\tau$,
$\cor_l - \cor_u$ was slightly positive for noise, but slightly negative for 
population model outputs (Fig. \ref{SM-fig_Cause4copula_C_kend_sRicker_nsd_1}); 
and likewise for SG and SJ copulas (Figs \ref{SM-fig_Cause4copula_SG_kend_sRicker_nsd_1}, 
\ref{SM-fig_Cause4copula_SJ_kend_sRicker_nsd_1}). Overall,
similarities between noise and model-output copula structure
were more noticable than discrepancies, in spite of nonlinearities.
We repeated the analysis with $r=1.3$. Discrepancies between noise and population
copula structure in this case were often glaring. Apparently noise of standard deviation 1
interacted very strongly with model nonlinearities when the model was in its overcompensatory 
regime.  

For the model we examined, causal hypothesis D (Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}) was 
correct that asymmetric tail dependence in evolutionary changes 
can produce similarly asymmetric tail dependence in character distributions across
phylogeny tips (Appendix \ref{SM-evol_mech}, Fig. \ref{SM-fig_cop_evo} for details). This topic 
is revisited in the Discussion.

# Background, concepts and methods for testing the consequential hypotheses\label{Consequences}

The hypothesis was presented that
the distribution (through time) of a spatially averaged quantity should be influenced by 
dependencies between the local quantities, including their
copula structure and tail dependence (Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}, X). 
To refine this hypothesis, suppose an ecological variable 
$E_i(t)$ is measured at locations $i=1,\ldots,N$ and times $t=1,\ldots,T$, and
the spatial mean $\sum_i E_i(t)/N$ is of
interest. The $E_i(t)$ could be, for instance, local abundances of a pest or 
exploited species, or local fluxes of a greenhouse gas. If  $E_i$ and $E_j$ are 
right-tail dependent for most location pairs $i$ and $j$, then
exceptionally large values tend to occur at the same time in most locations.
We hypothesize that this 
will tend to increase the skewness of the distribution 
of the spatial mean. Similarly, left-tail dependence between local variables
should tend to decrease skewness. Strong positive skewness of the 
spatial mean corresponds to "spikiness" of the spatial-mean time series. 
The spatial-mean time series and its skewness may be quantities of 
principal importance for 
pest or resource abundance, for which extreme values (spikes) 
in the spatial-mean have large effects.

We tested hypothesis X 
using our multivariate datasets (Table \ref{tab_multivar_summary}).
For each dataset we calculated the spatial mean time series, and then 
the skewness through time of that
mean. Then, for each dataset, we compared the value obtained 
to a distribution of values 
of the same quantity for each of 10000 surrogate datasets. Surrogate 
datasets were produced by randomizing the empirical data
in a special way to have the 
copula structure of a multivariate-normal distribution, but to retain exactly the same
distributions of values for each sampling location as the original data
(Appendix \ref{SM-Surrog_multi}). 
Surrogates also had very similar Spearman correlations between pairs of sampling locations
as the data. 
Our comparisons therefore tested the null hypothesis that the skewness of the spatial 
mean took values on the empirical data no different from what one would expect if the copula
structure of the data were multivariate N, but the data were otherwise statistically
unchanged. Significant differences indicate that non-N copula structure in the data 
contributed to the skewness of the spatial mean, i.e., to its "spikiness".

For green spruce aphid abundance data, *C. furca* abundance data, and methane-flux
data, because these datasets exhibited lower-tail dependence 
(Table \ref{tab_multivar_summary}), we compared empirical and surrogate skewness values
via a one-tailed test in the left tail: the $p$-value was the fraction
of surrogate skewnesses less than the skewness for the empirical data; the test
examines whether lower-tail dependence caused the spatial average to have significantly lower
skewness than would have been expected without tail dependence. For
leaf-curling plum aphid data, because that dataset exhibited upper-tail 
dependence (Table \ref{tab_multivar_summary}), we did the analogous one-tailed test
in the right tail. The test examines whether upper-tail dependence caused the spatial
average to have significantly higher skewness than 
expected without tail dependence.

We also examined hypothesis Y on Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}, i.e., that spatial 
tail dependence of an environmental variable can influence the 
extinction risk of a metapopulation. We hypothesized that environmental noises
exhibiting greater left-tail dependence across different habitat patches would 
cause higher metapopulation extinction risks because then very bad years for the 
component populations would occur simultaneously in many patches,
reducing rescue effects. Here we assume, for simplicity, 
that low values of the environmental
variable are "bad" for the populations and high values are "good".
We tested the reasonableness of Y using a metapopulation
extension of the Lewontin-Cohen model,
$\vec{P}(t+1) = D \lambda(t) \vec{P}(t)$,
where the $i^{th}$ component of the length-$N$ vector 
$\vec{P}(t)$ represents
population density in the $i^{th}$ habitat patch at time $t$. 
The $N \times N$ matrix $\lambda(t)$ was diagonal with $i^{th}$ diagonal entry 
$\exp(r+\epsilon_i(t))$. Here $r$ is a growth rate; we used $r=0$. The
$\epsilon_i(t)$ represent environmental noises. They were standard-normally 
distributed, were independent through time, and showed the same 
spatial correlations for every simulation, 
but were made to exhibit right- or left-tail dependence between patches in
different simulations (Appendix \ref{SM-ext_risk_model}). The $N \times N$
matrix $D$ was a dispersal matrix
modelling local or global dispersal at rate $d$, in different simulations
(Appendix \ref{SM-ext_risk_model}).
After each step, 
if the density in a patch was $<1$, it was
set to $0$. We simulated the model 10000 times for each combination of parameters,
starting from $p_0 = 50$ in each patch, 
and calculated extinction risk after $25$ time steps.

# Results of testing the consequential hypotheses: Tail dependence influences skewness of the spatial average, extinction risk, and Taylor's law

\noindent Skewness results were consistent with 
consequential hypothesis X. For datasets that
exhibited strong lower-tail (respectively, upper-tail) 
dependence in earlier analyses (green spruce 
aphid abundance data for lower-tail, and leaf-curling plum aphid first flight data
for upper-tail, Table 
\ref{tab_multivar_summary}), skewness of the spatial average 
was less than (respectively, greater than) a significant fraction of 
surrogate skewness values 
(Fig. \ref{fig_skewness_spearman}A,B). For datasets with moderate lower-tail 
dependence (\emph{Ceratium furca} abundance and methane data), skewness of the spatial
average showed a non-significant or marginally significant tendency 
toward being less than surrogate skewnesses (Fig. \ref{fig_skewness_spearman}C,D).

Consistent with hypothesis Y, 
left-tail dependent environmental fluctuations increased metapopulation
extinction risk for the spatial 
Lewontin-Cohen model (Fig. \ref{fig_extrisk_lcohen_local}), 
for $N=5$ and $N=25$ habitat patches, and for local 
(Fig. \ref{fig_extrisk_lcohen_local}) and global (Fig. \ref{SM-fig_extrisk_lcohen_global})
dispersal. We also substantiated using models (Appendix \ref{SM-Consequence_TL_simulation}, \ref{SM-sect:copsurrognd}, Fig. \ref{SM-fig_spTL})
a consequential hypothesis Z (Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}), that 
Taylor's law can be influenced by
tail dependence.

# Discussion \label{Discussion}

<!--what we did and why is it important to study?-->
We showed that non-N copula structure and asymmetric tail dependence are 
common across multiple sub-disciplines
in ecology, although no 
research we know of has 
taken this structure into account. We hypothesized four 
mechanisms that may cause non-N copula structures.
We discuss below how commonly some of our
mechanisms may opperate. 
We also hypothesized and demonstrated important consequences of 
non-N copula structure and tail-dependence. 
For instance, the skewness
of a spatial-average time series is influenced by tail dependencies between its 
constituent time series: right-tail-dependent local time series 
lead to "spiky" spatially averaged time series, with large outbreaks.
Thus tail dependence could have implications for exploited and pest species.
Extinction risk can be altered by tail dependence
properties of environmental variables. 
In our view, our results make our "overall hypothesis" (Introduction)
reasonable and worthy of broader testing. We illustrated 
how such tests might be carried out by performing tests ourselves on 
example datasets and models. Further suggestions for tests are below.
It seems likely that comprehensive understanding 
of many ecological phenomena is impossible without 
a complete copula characterization of dependence. 

Copula approaches are
well developed [@joe2014_dependence; @nelsen2006_copula], and 
computer implementations exist (`copula` and 
`VineCopula` packages). Ecologists can apply these tools
immediately. We created several interrelated randomization procedures
(Appendices \ref{SM-surrog_test}, \ref{SM-Surrog_multi}, \ref{SM-sect:copsurrognd}) 
that build upon existing methods.

<!--a para on how likely one is to get copula structure via the Liebig mechanism-->
Our first causal mechanism (Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}, A) probably operates commonly,
for two reasons.
First, Liebig's law and the idea of limiting 
nutrients are dominant paradigms in ecology.
Second, although we did not systematically test the first two parts of 
hypothesis A, many studies have documented nonlinear or threshold influences of environmental
variables on ecological quantities. 
These first two parts of A could be tested for numerous 
datasets by examining copulas for environmental and ecological
variables. See below discussion about the green spruce aphid, and 
Appendix \ref{SM-sect:greenspruce}, which illustrate how to do this.
Causal mechanism C, which we also did not test, could be tested
by analyzing copulas of abundances of competing species, sampled across space or
time.

<!--para on how likely one is to get copula structure via the Moran mechanism-->
There are also reasons to expect our Moran mechanism (Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}, B) 
operates commonly: Moran effects are common [@Liebhold2004], and 
non-N and tail-dependent copula structures are often found in 
environmental variables. If intense meteorological events are 
also widespread, then
environmental variables associated with these events should take extreme
values simultaneously across large spatial areas, producing tail dependence in measurements
made through time at different locations. Non-extreme values may instead
be associated with local phenomena, and therefore may be
less correlated across large areas.
@Serinaldi2008 examined the spatial dependence 
of rainfall in Central Italy; G or Student 2-copulas 
were candidates for modelling dependence, and 
neither of these is an N copula.
A long-term study (1950–2014) in the Loess Plateau of China [@She2018]
showed that a G copula effectively modeled 
the spatial dependence of drought variables.
Bivariate copula analysis was also used in forecasting the 
co-occurrence of extreme events (flood or drought) 
over the North Sikkim Himalayas using spatial datasets [@Goswami2018]. 

<!--Holder stuff-->
Our simulations of character evolution suggest the hypothesis that
changes through evolutionary time in bird and 
mammal BMR and body size may exhibit right-tail dependence,
contrary to standard normality assumptions of character evolution models. This is
a hypothesis only, because the right-tail dependence of Fig. \ref{fig_biv_multi_raw_cop}F,G
could have come about in another, unknown way. Our simulations show that tail dependence 
in evolutionary changes is sufficient, but may not be necessary, to produce tail
dependence in characters of extant species. For instance, (see below, 
Appendix \ref{SM-sect:missingdata}, Fig. \ref{SM-fig:missingdata}), 
systematically missing data can also produce tail dependence and may
have influenced results for the BMR-body mass datasets. Even if the hypothesized 
evolutionary mechanism (Fig. \ref{MasterFigure}, D)
is correct, our results only replace one question, i.e., why do we see right-tail
dependence between BMR and body mass, with another,
i.e., why might we see right-tail dependence in evolutionary changes in these traits?
See Appendix \ref{SM-evol_mech} for further thoughts on potential importance of 
copulas for character evolution.

<!--Discuss stuff here on tradeoff and life history that Bever told me about-->
Relationships between BMR and body mass relate
to a trade-off between mass-specific BMR (BMR per unit body mass) and body
mass itself. Copulas probably interrelate with 
life-history trade-off theory in additional ways beyond what we demonstrated.
For instance, it is well known that energy allocation to a life function, F (e.g., reproduction)
will reduce the energy that can be allocated to other functions, $G_1$, $G_2$, $G_3$ 
(e.g., growth, predation avoidance). This is the principle of 
allocation. But F can trade off against any or all of 
the $G_i$. Therefore, for large F, approaching absolute 
limitations, there may be a strong 
association between F and $G_1$. For small F, there may be
little association because resources not allocated to F can instead be allocated 
to any combination of the $G_i$. This constitutes 
asymmetric tail dependence between F and $G_1$. @Winemiller1992
described a three-way trade-off in fishes between age of reproductive
maturity, juvenile survivorship, and fecundity. The trade-off should, in theory,
produce a tight association between age of maturity and fecundity for 
fishes with low age of maturity, but little such association for later-maturing
fishes because those fishes may invest the resources not invested in maturing quickly into
either fecundity or juvenile survival.
These ideas suggest that copulas will be 
useful for studying multi-dimensional trade-offs. But applications will 
require careful attention to the possible consequences of biased sampling:
if the degree of completeness of a dataset is associated with one or
more of the characters, then statistical artefacts
can bias conclusions (Appendix \ref{SM-sect:missingdata}, 
Fig. \ref{SM-fig:missingdata}).

<!-- We have only given a few mechanisms, but there are likely to be others, and discoverig
additional mechanisms of copula structure is certainly worthy of future work. -->
Other mechanisms probably also operate, 
and should be considered. For instance, 
measurement error may modify copula structure. 
Our models were intentionally simple in other respects, 
too, not including
delayed density dependence, dispersal, population stage structure, trophic
interactions, and other factors.
We hope by enumerating a few potential mechanisms of copula structure,
we inspire additional research on the
potentially numerous mechanisms that may operate in diverse datasets.

<!--some consequences paragraphs next-->

<!--green spruce aphid all the way from causes to consequences-->
Our hypotheses cover propagation of copula structure from causes, 
to data, to consequences.
We here take a closer look at the green spruce aphid, which simultaneously illustrates 
all these stages.
Green spruce aphid abundance, as measured in the data we use,
is strongly influenced by temperature of the previous winter (@Sheppard2016,
supplementary fig. 6).
For each of our 10 sampling locations, we therefore 
examined (Appendix \ref{SM-sect:greenspruce}, 
Fig. \ref{SM-fig:greenspruce}, Table \ref{SM-tab:greenspruce}) the copula of winter temperature
and aphid abundance time series for the location, finding 
left-tail dependence: apparently winter temperature has an asymmetric
influence on abundance in that cold winters produce low abundances
but warm winters often do not yield higher abundances than moderate winters.
Although we did not systematically test the first two 
parts of hypothesis A due to much existing evidence, this result 
illustrates how those parts can be tested using copula
techniques. The third part of hypothesis A, which our modelling results
supported, therefore suggests spatial dependence between green spruce aphid counts
in different locations should show left-tail dependence - exactly as observed 
(Table \ref{tab_multivar_summary}). And the consequences of such tail 
dependence for the skewness of spatially averaged aphid counts was described previously 
(Fig. \ref{fig_skewness_spearman}A). Thus the asymmetric influence of winter 
temperature ultimately causes spatially averaged aphid abundances to have
lower skew than they would otherwise, because negative impacts of cold winter
are spatially synchronous.
 
<!--***DAN: could remove the next para if you need to save words-->
<!--a para on stability of the total biomass time series in a community, and skewness - sets up Shya's later paper as future work-->
Our results showed that the skewness of the 
spatial average of local time series is influenced 
by their tail dependence. But the same logic should also apply to any collection of time
series, whether associated with locations in space or not. 
Another potential application is time series of all species from a single community, e.g., all
plants in a quadrat surveyed repeatedly over time. A huge 
literature has focused on synchrony versus 
compensatory dynamics between such time series, and 
the influence of interspecific relationships on the 
variability of community
properties such as total biomass. Typically, variability of community biomass 
is measured with the coefficient of variation, but skewness
may also be of interest because it can help characterize "spikiness" 
through time. Future work on copula 
structure of interspecific relationships in communities and its implications for community 
variability is likely to be valuable.

<!--***DAN: could remove the next para if you need to save words-->
<!--A para that sets up Shya's extinction risk paper-->
Although we demonstrated that tail dependence between environmental variables
can influence extinction risk, substantial work remains to determine the importance 
of this effect. First, we used 
a non-density-dependent model. Do similar results pertain
when density dependence
acts? Second, we considered metapopulation extinction risk, but the huge field 
of population viability analysis (PVA) via stochastic 
matrix modelling [@Caswell2000; @MorrisDoak2002]
uses a framework in which a single population's vital rates (e.g., life-stage-specific 
fecundity and survival rates) are considered to
vary stochastically through time due to environmental variation. Do relationships
between different vital rates exhibit tail dependence, and does tail dependence 
influence extinction risk in this context?
Finally, is the copula structure of environmental variables
changing through time, and, if so, how do such changes influence extinction risks?
Climate change is known to amplify the factors that lead to extreme weather events
[@Hansen2012] and hence may alter tail dependence.
