Closed static flux chamber method was used (Holland et al. 1999) to measure methane fluxes
at 28 chambers across a hydrologic gradient (upland to seasonal wetland) at daily to weekly interval from September 2015 to September 2016 (Jarecke et al. 2016). See Smyth et al. (2019) for additional details on greenhouse gas flux methods for the Great Miami Wetland Mitigation Bank in Trotwood, Ohio.
