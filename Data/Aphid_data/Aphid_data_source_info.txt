We thank James Bell of the Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS). We used the aphid abundance, first flight date 
and monthly temperature data saved in APHID_DATA_RAW folder. These data were computed from the Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS) suction-trap dataset (Harrington 2014; Bell et al. 2015) and can be accessed upon requesting the competent authority.
