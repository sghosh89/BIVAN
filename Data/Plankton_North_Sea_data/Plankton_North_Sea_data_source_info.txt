Plankton abundance data along with lattitudes, longitudes of the surveying co-ordinates can be accessed upon request from Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) dataset, now operated and maintained by the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom. Data pre-processing was similar but not identical to that of Sheppard et al. (2017). To see how we processed the data, please see Appendix S2 in Supporting Information.
